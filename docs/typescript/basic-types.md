# any

-   opt-out of type checking

# void

-   void is a little like the opposite of any: the absence of having any type at all.

# never

-   The never type represents the type of values that never occur.
-   The never type is a subtype of, and assignable to, every type; however, no type is a subtype of, or assignable to, never (except never itself). Even any isnâ€™t assignable to never.
