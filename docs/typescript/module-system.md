# Module

-   A module, in a nutshell, is a JavaScript file that operates in a sandbox environment and exposes some values to the public.

# Type Declarations

-   types in TypeScript can be imported and exported like regular JavaScript values but their import or export statements do not appear in the final compiled JavaScript.
