- A **controlled input** accepts its current value as a prop, as well as a callback to change that value. It’s a “React way”
  - data (state) and UI (inputs) are always in sync
- An **uncontrolled input** stores its own state internally, using DOM API.
  - integrate React and non-React code
- React Event System
  - capturing and bubbling
    - target and currentTarget
    - with bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
    - With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
    - Event Delegation Pattern
      - a method of attaching event handlers not to the elements from which you actually want to handle events, but to a higher-level element.
      - the main point is in centralizing decision-making, thereby reducing the number of decision-making points.
- **Portals** provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
