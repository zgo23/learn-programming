# General

-   The main goal of Hooks is to decouple stateful logic from rendering logic.
-   we cannot access the updated state of a functional component until the next re-render.
-   Hooks require a completely different mindset from classic React development. We should not think about the life cycle of components anymore. Instead, we should think about data flow.
-   useReducer is an alternative to useState. it is used to deal with complex state logic.
