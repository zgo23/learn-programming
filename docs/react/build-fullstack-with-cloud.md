# Goal

-   Learn how to build real-world full stack applictions in the cloud leveraing AWS services on the backend and React on the front end.

# DevOps

-   (What is DevOps?)[https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/]

# Modern Serverless philosophy

## Serverless meaning

-   how to most efficiently deliver business value with a focus on writing business logic, instead of coding supporting infrastructure for your business logic.
-   While cloud functions—packaged as FaaS (Function as a Service) offerings—represent the core of serverless computing, cloud platforms also provide specialized serverless frameworks that cater to specific application requirements as BaaS (Backend as a Service) offerings. Put simply, serverless computing = FaaS + BaaS.

## Function as a Service (FaaS)

## Backend as a Service (BaaS)

-   Backend as a service (BaaS) typically refers to managed services like databases (Firestore, Amazon DynamoDB), authentication services (Auth0, Amazon Cognito), and artificial intelligence services (Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Comprehend), among other managed services.

# AWS

## AWS Serverless Application Model(SAM)

-   SAM allows you to build serverless applications by defining the API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application in YAML files. It uses a combination of YAML configuration and function code and a CLI to create, manage, and deploy serverless applications.

## AWS CloudFormation

-   SAM is an extension of CloudFormation.

## AWS Amplify

-   The Amplify Framework is a combination of four things: CLI, client library, toolchain, and web-hosting platform. Amplify’s purpose is to provide an easy way for developers to build and deploy full stack web and mobile applications that leverage the cloud. It enables not only features such as serverless functions and authentication, but also GraphQL APIs, machine learning (ML), storage, analytics, push notifications, and more.

### CLI

-   The CLI allows you to create, configure, and deploy cloud services from the command line.

### Client Library

-   The Client library allows you to connect to and interact with these cloud services from your web or mobile application.
-   The Amplify client is a library made especially to provide an easy-to-use API for JavaScript applications that need to interact with AWS services. Amplify also has client SDKs for React Native, native iOS, and native Android.

### Toochain

-   The toolchain helps facilitate and speed development by doing things like generating code and serverless function boilerplates.

### Hosting Platform

-   The hosting platform allows you to deploy your application to a live domain complete with atomic deployments, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), custom domains, and more.

## AWS Cognito

## AWS S3

## Amazon API Gateway

## AWS AppSync

-   AWS AppSync is a managed API layer that uses GraphQL to make it easy for applications to interact with any data source, REST API, or microservice.

## Amazon DynamoDB

# Serverless functions

# React

## React Context for State Management
