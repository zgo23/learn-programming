- Rendering component trees in a simplified test environment and asserting on their output.
- [React Testing Library Vs. Enzyme](https://medium.com/wesionary-team/react-testing-library-vs-enzyme-afd29db380ac)
- A **mock** is a convincing duplicate of an object or module without any real inner workings.
- Mock functions are also known as **“spies”**, because they let you spy on the behavior of a function that is called directly by some other code, rather than only testing the output.
- Tools used include: jest, enzyme, enzyme-to-json (for Snapshot testing), react testing library, sinon

# Regression

- Jest will recognize any file with the suffix .spec.js or .test.js as tests.
