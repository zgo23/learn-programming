# Requirment Definition

-   The PMBOK® Guide, Fifth Edition, describes requirements as “conditions or capabilities that must be met by the project or present in the product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification.” It further explains that requirements “include the quantified and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the scope baseline and be measured once project execution begins.”
