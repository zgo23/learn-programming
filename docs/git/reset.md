# What git reset does?

-   Step1: Move Head: moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to. This means if HEAD is set to the master branch (i.e. youâ€™re currently on the master branch), running git reset 9e5e6a4 will start by making master point to 9e5e6a4. With **reset --soft**, it will simply stop there. it essentially undid the last git commit command.
-   Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed), default behaviour of **git reset**. it still undid your last commit, but also unstaged everything. You rolled back to before you ran all your git add and git commit commands.
-   Step 3: Updating the Working Directory (--hard), You undid your last commit, the git add and git commit commands, and all the work you did in your working directory.
-   Recap

    1. Move the branch HEAD points to (stop here if --soft).
    2. Make the index look like HEAD (stop here unless --hard).
    3. Make the working directory look like the index.

# What does **git reset <file_path>** do?

-   copy the file from the snapshot pointed by Head to the index. This has the practical effect of unstaging the file.
