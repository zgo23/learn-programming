# General

-   Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes.
-   If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing any tools, you can try out Snack.

# Components

-   Expo CLI

    `yarn global add expo-cli`

-   Expo Client
-   Expo Dev Tools
    -   A Web UI

# Dependencies

-   Ngrok
    -   Ngrok exposes local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.

# Workflows

## The Managed Workflow

-   like Create React App
-   The Expo managed workflow provides a shared native runtime so you don't write native code, you focus on writing your React app in JavaScript.

## The Bare Workflow
