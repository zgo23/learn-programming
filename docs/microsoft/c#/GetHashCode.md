-   A correct implementation of **GetHashCode** must meet two requirements:
    -   The first is that whatever number an instance returns as its hash code, that instance must continue to return the same code as long as its own value does not change.
    -   The second requirement is that two instances that have equal values according to their Equals methods must return the same hash code.
