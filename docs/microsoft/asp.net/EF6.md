-   By default, Entity Framework enables cascade deletes for non-nullable foreign keys
-   The database context is the main class that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for a data model.
-   there is typically one database context class per database, although in more complex projects it is possible to have more.
-   The Entity Data Model backing the context can be specified in several ways.
    -   When using the Code First approach, the DbSet<TEntity> properties on the derived context are used to build a model by convention.
-   The connection to the database (including the name of the database) can be specified in several ways.
    -   If the parameterless DbContext constructor is called from a derived context, then the name of the derived context is used to find a connection string in the app.config or web.config file.
    -   Instead of using the derived context name, the connection/database name can also be specified explicitly by passing the name to one of the DbContext constructors that takes a string.
